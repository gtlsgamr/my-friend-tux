# My Friend Tux üêß (`mftux.sh`)

## Description

This script is a digital companion for you. It can help you with absolutely
nothing, other than just being cute. It's a simple script that displays a
penguin which will grow as time goes by. You have to feed him by running the
 script every day. If you don't feed him, he will die. So, don't let him die.
 He also shows you the current date and time. That's it. Nothing more, nothing
 less. On the bright side, he is a good listener. You can talk to him whenever
 you feel lonely. He will listen to you without any judgement. So, go ahead
 and run the script. Have fun!
